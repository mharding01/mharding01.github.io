A little about myself: I am a prolific coder trying to dig my heels deeper into 
both industry and academia. I believe that there is a place in our society for 
autonomous systems like AV's, assistive robotics, and even robot-butlers, and I am trying
to find where I can contribute wherever I can. My research interests have taken me
to explore the state-of-the-art in robot manipulation under uncertainty under Drs.
	Sidd Srinivasa (now at UWash), Matt Mason (CMU), Erol Sahin (METU) to 
modeling biologically-inspired humanoid locomotion under Dr. Auke Ijspeert (EPFL).
Before I graduate from CMU in Spring 2019, I hope to have joined an autonomous vehicles
research team based between CMU's ECE department and the Robotics Institute.
