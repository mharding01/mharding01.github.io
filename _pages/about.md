A little about myself: I am a meticulous engineer with project experience in both industry and academia. 
I believe that there is a place in our society for 
autonomous systems like AV's, assistive robotics, and even robot-butlers, and I am trying
to find where I can contribute whenever I can. 

My research interests during my undergraduate at CMU had taken me
to explore the state-of-the-art in robot manipulation under uncertainty under Drs.
	Sidd Srinivasa (now at UWash), Matt Mason (CMU), Erol Sahin (visiting from METU) to 
modeling biologically-inspired humanoid locomotion under Dr. Auke Ijspeert (EPFL).
During my Masters at CMU (2019), I completed publishable robotics research with AV researchers on scheduling GPU-sharing across ML, DNN, and graphics clients.

I currently work under the DRIVE Platform team at NVIDIA. Please feel free to reach out via LinkedIn or email at
