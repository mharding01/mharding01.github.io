A little about myself: I am a prolific coder trying to dig my heels deeper into 
both industry and academia. I believe that there is a place in our society for 
autonomous systems like AV's, assistive robotics, and even robot-butlers, and I am trying
to find where I can contribute whenever I can. 

My research interests during my undergraduate at CMU had taken me
to explore the state-of-the-art in robot manipulation under uncertainty under Drs.
	Sidd Srinivasa (now at UWash), Matt Mason (CMU), Erol Sahin (visiting from METU) to 
modeling biologically-inspired humanoid locomotion under Dr. Auke Ijspeert (EPFL).
Before I graduate from CMU with my M.S. in spring 2019, I hope to have completed 
further publishable robotics research with AV researchers from CMU's ECE department and Robotics Institute.

I am also open to seeking full-time employment opportunities for after graduation
in robotics and machine learning. Please feel free to reach out via LinkedIn or email at
